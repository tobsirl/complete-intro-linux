Frontend Master Course on Linux commands

## Environments

```bash
# print all environment variables
printenv

# print out the name in $USER
echo hello my name is $USER

USER=paul echo hello my name is $USER # hello my name is brian
echo hello my name is $USER # hello my name is ubuntu
```

## Per Session

```bash
echo $GREETING # nothing
GREETING=hello
echo $GREETING # hello
```

## Permanent

`/etc/environment` change for everyone, not recommended

`/etc/profile` `/etc/bashrc` `/etc/zshrc` system-wide

## .bashrc and .bash_profile

`.bash_profile` is only run on login shells
`.bashrc` is run on every nonlogin shell

```bash
# add to .bash_profile to ignore and always run .bashrc
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi
```

```bash
# reload file
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Processes

```bash
ps # list all running processes

sleep 10 & # & means run in the background
ps

sleep 100 &
ps # find the sleep pid
kill -s SIGKILL <the pid from above>
ps # notice the process has been killed

ps aux # shows every process running

ps aux | grep ps
```

## Foreground and Background

```bash
sleep 100
# hit CTRL + Z
jobs # notice process is stopped
bg 1 # it's the first and only item in the list, the number refers to that
jobs # notice process is running
fg 1 # reattch to the process
```

## Exit Codes

A program that successfully runs and exits by itself will have an exit code of 0.

```bash
date # show current date, runs successfully
echo $? # $? corresponds to the last exit code, in this case 0
yes # hit CTRL+C to stop it
echo $? # you stopped it so it exited with a non-zero code, 130
```

### Common exit codes

- 0: means it was successful. Anything other than 0 means it failed
- 1: a good general catch-all "there was an error"
- 2: a bash internal error, meaning you or the program tried to use bash in an incorrect way
- 126: Either you don't have permission or the file isn't executable
- 127: Command not found
- 128: The exit command itself had a problem, usually that you provided a non-integer exit code to it
- 130: You ended the program with CTRL+C
- 137: You ended the program with SIGKILL
- 255: Out-of-bounds, you tried to exit with a code larger than 255

### Run if first one succeeds

```bash
touch status.txt && date >> status.txt && uptime >> status.txt
cat status.txt
```

You can see it does all three commands right in a row. That's what the `&&` operator does. It runs from left to right (touch, date, then uptime). The `&&` operator will bail if any of those commands fails.

### Run if first one fails

`||` if one fails

```bash
false || echo hi # you'll see hi
false && echo hi # you won't see hi
```

### Always Run

To always run the second command

```bash
false ; true ; echo hey # you'll see hey
```

### Subcommands

Running commands within a command.

```bash
echo I think $(whoami) is a very cool user # I think ubuntu is very cool
```

`$()` allows you to run commands inside of another command. You can also use backticks ``

```bash
echo $(date +%x) â€“ $(uptime) >> log.txt
```

## wget

wget works like cp but instead of copying a local file you're copying something off the net.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btholt/bash2048/master/bash2048.sh
chmod 700 bash2048.sh
. bash2048.sh
```

## curl

```bash
# run python server
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0 

curl http://localhost:8000 # request to the server
```

### Output

curl can be used in a greater chain of commands.
`curl <url> > output.txt`

You can also use `-o <file name>` to redirect output to a file or just `-O` to redirect it to a file named by the same file name

### HTTP Verbs

`curl -I http://localhost:8000`
This will send a HEAD request instead of a GET request. HEAD requests just get the endpoint metadata and don't actually do a full request.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000
curl -d "this is the body being sent with the HTTP request" http://localhost:8000
# both of these requests will fail because our static
# file server doesn't know what to do with POST requests
```

`-X` allows you to specify what verb you want to use.
